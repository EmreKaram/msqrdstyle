            A.F.VANDEVORST is a Belgian fashion brand, based in Antwerp.

            Designers An Vandevorst and Filip Arickx met in 1987 on their first
            day of school at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp. An
            Vandevorst was Dries Van Noten's first assistant for six and a half
            years.

            “I HAD BEEN COLLECTING IT SINCE I WAS A CHILD - PIECES FROM THE RED
            CROSS. AND THEN I MET AN WHEN I WAS 18 AND FOUND OUT SHE ALSO
            COLLECTED IT” - FILIP ARICKX.

            Ten years later, they set up their company Blixa and presented their
            first collection as A.F.VANDEVORST in Paris. The collection already
            included all of the references and inspirations that came to play a
            defining role in the brand over the past 20 years: Joseph Beuys, the
            red cross, religion, horses and horse-riding accoutrements, rivets,
            lingerie, uniforms and fetish shoes.
          </p>
          <p class="small">
            The designer duo is known for their many collaborations, unique
            installations and artistic pursuits. From Biennale-installations to
            traveling guerrilla stores, their work has been critically acclaimed
            around the world. In line with their artistic focus and dedication
            to craftsmanship, A.F.VANDEVORST is proud to show their work during
            Haute Couture in Paris.
          </p>
          <p class="small">
            The flagship store - designed together with the Antwerp-based
            scenographer Bob Verhelst - is based in the heart of Antwerp. Not
            only did it become a personal statement about the essence of the
            brand, it also creates a space to welcome costumers into the
            A.F.VANDEVORST universe.

            “IT HAS BEEN BEEN BEAUTIFUL LOOKING BACK OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS, BUT
            IS EQUALLY AS BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK TOWARDS THE FUTURE.” -

          </p>
          <p class="small">
            In 2018 A.F.VANDEVORST released "ENDE NEU" at Galerie Yvon Lambert
            in Paris, a retrospective book that celebrates the brand's 20th
            anniversary. "ENDE NEU" is a song from Einstürzende Neubauten that
            we used for our Spring/Summer 2001 show. It means "an end" and
            something "new".

            In Spring Summer 2018, A.F.Vandevorst presented ALWAYS+FOREVER - a
            carefully curated selection from the archives. This was not a
            retrospective, it was a re-imagination. 40 looks, from 40 seasons
            were considered in a contemporary light; unquestionably wearable
            today.The looks were in chronological order, starting with the first
            season and ending with the most recent. Upon reflection, the
            integrity of A.F.Vandevorst was beautifully apparent in their
            homogeneous colour scheme, feminine/masculine contrasting, and
            paradoxical combinations.
          </p>
          <p class="small">
            After a 22 year journey, An Vandevorst and Filip Arickx announced
            the closure of their fashion label A.F.Vandevorst and took a final
            bow. The last collection available in store was Spring Summer 2020.
            As a final goodbye they hosted an event during Paris Fashion Week in
            February 2020 to thank everyone who supported them. Simultaneously
            to give a second life to their extensive archive of over 2000 pieces
            they showcased a selection during this event to collectors and
            museums. Their heritage and unique pieces will now be kept and
            curated in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art New
            York, FIT New York, LACMA Los Angeles, Palais Galliera Paris, NGV
            Melbourne, MoMu Antwerp, ModeMuseum Hasselt and many other private
            collectors.
